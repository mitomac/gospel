      "text": "Since many have undertaken to set in order a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us,\neven as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word delivered them to us,\nit seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus;\nthat you might know the certainty concerning the things in which you were instructed.\nThere was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.\nThey were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.\nBut they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in years.\nNow while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his division,\naccording to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.\nThe whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.\nAn angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.\nZacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.\nBut the angel said to him, “Don’t be afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been heard, and your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.\nYou will have joy and gladness; and many will rejoice at his birth.\nFor he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb.\nHe will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord, their God.\nHe will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, ‘to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,’ and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to prepare a people prepared for the Lord.”\nZacharias said to the angel, “How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.”\nThe angel answered him, “I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news.\nBehold, you will be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things will happen, because you didn’t believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time.”\nThe people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled that he delayed in the temple.\nWhen he came out, he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. He continued making signs to them, and remained mute.\nWhen the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house.\nAfter these days Elizabeth, his wife, conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying,\n“Thus has the Lord done to me in the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach among men.”\nNow in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,\nto a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of David’s house. The virgin’s name was Mary.\nHaving come in, the angel said to her, “Rejoice, you highly favored one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women!”\nBut when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of salutation this might be.\nThe angel said to her, “Don’t be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.\nBehold, you will conceive in your womb, and give birth to a son, and will call his name ‘Jesus.’\nHe will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father, David,\nand he will reign over the house of Jacob forever. There will be no end to his Kingdom.”\nMary said to the angel, “How can this be, seeing I am a virgin?”\nThe angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore also the holy one who is born from you will be called the Son of God.\nBehold, Elizabeth, your relative, also has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.\nFor nothing spoken by God is impossible.”\nMary said, “Behold, the servant of the Lord; let it be done to me according to your word.”\nThe angel departed from her.\nMary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah,\nand entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.\nWhen Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.\nShe called out with a loud voice, and said, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!\nWhy am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?\nFor behold, when the voice of your greeting came into my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy!\nBlessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord!”\nMary said,\n“My soul magnifies the Lord.\nMy spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior,\nfor he has looked at the humble state of his servant.\nFor behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed.\nFor he who is mighty has done great things for me.\nHoly is his name.\nHis mercy is for generations of generations on those who fear him.\nHe has shown strength with his arm.\nHe has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.\nHe has put down princes from their thrones.\nAnd has exalted the lowly.\nHe has filled the hungry with good things.\nHe has sent the rich away empty.\nHe has given help to Israel, his servant, that he might remember mercy,\nAs he spoke to our fathers,\nto Abraham and his offspring forever.”\nMary stayed with her about three months, and then returned to her house.\nNow the time that Elizabeth should give birth was fulfilled, and she gave birth to a son.\nHer neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her, and they rejoiced with her.\nOn the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.\nHis mother answered, “Not so; but he will be called John.”\nThey said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.”\nThey made signs to his father, what he would have him called.\nHe asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, “His name is John.”\nThey all marveled.\nHis mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue freed, and he spoke, blessing God.\nFear came on all who lived around them, and all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea.\nAll who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, “What then will this child be?” The hand of the Lord was with him.\nHis father, Zacharias, was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,\n“Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,\nfor he has visited and redeemed his people;\nand has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David\n(as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been from of old),\nsalvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us;\nto show mercy towards our fathers,\nto remember his holy covenant,\nthe oath which he swore to Abraham, our father,\nto grant to us that we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies,\nshould serve him without fear,\nIn holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life.\nAnd you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High,\nfor you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways,\nto give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission of their sins,\nbecause of the tender mercy of our God,\nwhereby the dawn from on high will visit us,\nto shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death;\nto guide our feet into the way of peace.”\nThe child was growing, and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the desert until the day of his public appearance to Israel.\n",

She wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn.\nThere were shepherds in the same country staying in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock.\nBehold, an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.\nThe angel said to them, “Don’t be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be to all the people.\nFor there is born to you today, in David’s city, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.\nThis is the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough.”\nSuddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising God, and saying,\n“Glory to God in the highest,\non earth peace, good will toward men.”\nWhen the angels went away from them into the sky, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem, now, and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.”\nThey came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby was lying in the feeding trough.\nWhen they saw it, they publicized widely the saying which was spoken to them about this child.\nAll who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds.\nBut Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.\nThe shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, just as it was told them.\nWhen eight days were fulfilled for the circumcision of the child, his name was called Jesus, which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.\nWhen the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord\n(as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord”),\nand to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, “A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.”\nBehold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him.\nIt had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.\nHe came in the Spirit into the temple. When the parents brought in the child, Jesus, that they might do concerning him according to the custom of the law,\nthen he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,\n“Now you are releasing your servant, Master,\naccording to your word, in peace;\nfor my eyes have seen your salvation,\nwhich you have prepared before the face of all peoples;\na light for revelation to the nations,\nand the glory of your people Israel.”\nJoseph and his mother were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning him,\nand Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary, his mother, “Behold, this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which is spoken against.\nYes, a sword will pierce through your own soul, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.”\nThere was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,\nand she had been a widow for about eighty-four years), who didn’t depart from the temple, worshiping with fastings and petitions night and day.\nComing up at that very hour, she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of him to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem.\nWhen they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.\nThe child was growing, and was becoming strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.\nHis parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover.\nWhen he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast,\nand when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem.

Every tree therefore that doesn’t produce good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire.”\nThe multitudes asked him, “What then must we do?”\nHe answered them, “He who has two coats, let him give to him who has none. He who has food, let him do likewise.”\nTax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, “Teacher, what must we do?”\nHe said to them, “Collect no more than that which is appointed to you.”\nSoldiers also asked him, saying, “What about us? What must we do?”\nHe said to them, “Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse anyone wrongfully. Be content with your wages.”\nAs the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he was the Christ,\nJohn answered them all, “I indeed baptize you with water, but he comes who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to loosen. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire,\nwhose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into his barn; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”\nThen with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people,\nbut Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias, his brother’s\n wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had done,\nadded this also to them all, that he shut up John in prison.\nNow when all the people were baptized, Jesus also had been baptized, and was praying. The sky was opened,\nand the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form like a dove on him; and a voice came out of the sky, saying “You are my beloved Son. In you I am well pleased.”\nJesus himself, when he began to teach, was about thirty years old, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli,\nthe son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,\nthe son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,\nthe son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Joseph, the son of Judah,\nthe son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,\nthe son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmodam, the son of Er,\nthe son of Jose, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,\nthe son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonan, the son of Eliakim,\nthe son of Melea, the son of Menan, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,\nthe son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,\nthe son of Amminadab, the son of Aram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,\nthe son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,\nthe son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,\nthe son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,\nthe son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan,\nthe son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.\n",

      "text": "Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness\nfor forty days, being tempted by the devil. He ate nothing in those days. Afterward, when they were completed, he was hungry.\nThe devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.”\nJesus answered him, saying,\n“It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.’”\nThe devil, leading him up on a high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.\nThe devil said to him, “I will give you all this authority, and their glory, for it has been delivered to me; and I give it to whomever I want.\nIf you therefore will worship before me, it will all be yours.”\nJesus answered him,\n“Get behind me Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.’”\nHe led him to Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down from here,\nfor it is written,\n‘He will put his angels in charge of you, to guard you;’\nand,\n‘On their hands they will bear you up,\nlest perhaps you dash your foot against a stone.’”\nJesus answering, said to him,\n“It has been said, ‘You shall not tempt the Lord your God.’”\nWhen the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from him until another time.\nJesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and news about him spread through all the surrounding area.\nHe taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.\nHe came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. He entered, as was his custom, into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read.\nThe book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. He opened the book, and found the place where it was written,\n\n“The Spirit of the Lord is on me,\nbecause he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor.\nHe has sent me to heal the broken hearted,\nto proclaim release to the captives,\nrecovering of sight to the blind,\nto deliver those who are crushed,\n\nand to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.”\nHe closed the book, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him.\nHe began to tell them,\n“Today, this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”\nAll testified about him, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth, and they said, “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?”\nHe said to them,\n“Doubtless you will tell me this parable, ‘Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in your hometown.’”\nHe said,\n“Most certainly I tell you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown.\n\n\nBut truly I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land.\n\n\nElijah was sent to none of them, except to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.\n\n\nThere were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed, except Naaman, the Syrian.”\nThey were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things.\nThey rose up, threw him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built on, that they might throw him off the cliff.\nBut he, passing through the middle of them, went his way.\nHe came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. He was teaching them on the Sabbath day,\nand they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority.\nIn the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,\nsaying, “Ah! what have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God!”\nJesus rebuked him, saying,\n“Be silent, and come out of him!”\n When the demon had thrown him down in the middle of them, he came out of him, having done him no harm.\nAmazement came on all, and they spoke together, one with another, saying, “What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!”\nNews about him went out into every place of the surrounding region.\nHe rose up from the synagogue, and entered into Simon’s house. Simon’s mother-in-law was afflicted with a great fever, and they begged him for her.\nHe stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her. Immediately she rose up and served them.\nWhen the sun was setting, all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.\nDemons also came out of many, crying out, and saying, “You are the Christ, the Son of God!” Rebuking them, he didn’t allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.\nWhen it was day, he departed and went into an uninhabited place, and the multitudes looked for him, and came to him, and held on to him, so that he wouldn’t go away from them.\nBut he said to them,\n“I must preach the good news of God’s Kingdom to the other cities also. For this reason I have been sent.”\nHe was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.\n",

      "text": "Now while the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.\nHe saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets.\nHe entered into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.\nWhen he had finished speaking, he said to Simon,\n“Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch.”\nSimon answered him, “Master, we worked all night, and took nothing; but at your word I will let down the net.”\nWhen they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking.\nThey beckoned to their partners in the other boat, that they should come and help them. They came, and filled both boats, so that they began to sink.\nBut Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.”\nFor he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had caught;\nand so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.\nJesus said to Simon,\n“Don’t be afraid. From now on you will be catching people alive.”\nWhen they had brought their boats to land, they left everything, and followed him.\nWhile he was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man full of leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and begged him, saying, “Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.”\nHe stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying,\n“I want to. Be made clean.”\nImmediately the leprosy left him.\nHe commanded him to tell no one,\n“But go your way, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”\nBut the report concerning him spread much more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.\nBut he withdrew himself into the desert, and prayed.\nOn one of those days, he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was with him to heal them.\nBehold, men brought a paralyzed man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus.\nNot finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the middle before Jesus.\nSeeing their faith, he said to him,\n“Man, your sins are forgiven you.”\nThe scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, “Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?”\nBut Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them,\n“Why are you reasoning so in your hearts?\n\n\nWhich is easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you;’ or to say, ‘Arise and walk?’\n\n\nBut that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins” (he said to the paralyzed man),\n“I tell you, arise, and take up your cot, and go to your house.”\nImmediately he rose up before them, and took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his house, glorifying God.\nAmazement took hold on all, and they glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, “We have seen strange things today.”\nAfter these things he went out, and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office, and said to him,\n“Follow me!”\nHe left everything, and rose up and followed him.\nLevi made a great feast for him in his house. There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them.\nTheir scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?”\nJesus answered them,\n“Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.\n\n\nI have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”\n\nThey said to him, “Why do John’s disciples often fast and pray, likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?”\nHe said to them,\n“Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast, while the bridegroom is with them?\n\n\nBut the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast in those days.”\nHe also told a parable to them.\n“No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment, or else he will tear the new, and also the piece from the new will not match the old.\n\n\nNo one puts new wine into old wine skins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed.\n\n\nBut new wine must be put into fresh wine skins, and both are preserved.\n\n\nNo man having drunk old wine immediately desires new, for he says, ‘The old is better.’”\n",

      "text": "Now on the second Sabbath after the first, he was going through the grain fields. His disciples plucked the heads of grain and ate, rubbing them in their hands.\nBut some of the Pharisees said to them, “Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?”\nJesus, answering them, said,\n“Haven’t you read what David did when he was hungry, he, and those who were with him;\n\n\nhow he entered into God’s house, and took and ate the show bread, and gave also to those who were with him, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?”\nHe said to them,\n“The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.”\nIt also happened on another Sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught. There was a man there, and his right hand was withered.\nThe scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against him.\nBut he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man who had the withered hand,\n“Rise up, and stand in the middle.” He arose and stood.\nThen Jesus said to them,\n“I will ask you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?”\nHe looked around at them all, and said to the man,\n“Stretch out your hand.” He did, and his hand was restored as sound as the other.\nBut they were filled with rage, and talked with one another about what they might do to Jesus.\nIn these days, he went out to the mountain to pray, and he continued all night in prayer to God.\nWhen it was day, he called his disciples, and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles:\nSimon, whom he also named Peter; Andrew, his brother; James; John; Philip; Bartholomew;\nMatthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Simon, who was called the Zealot;\nJudas the son of James; and Judas Iscariot, who also became a traitor.\nHe came down with them, and stood on a level place, with a crowd of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases;\nas well as those who were troubled by unclean spirits, and they were being healed.\nAll the multitude sought to touch him, for power came out of him and healed them all.\nHe lifted up his eyes to his disciples, and said,\n“Blessed are you who are poor,\nGod’s Kingdom is yours.\n\nBlessed are you who hunger now,\nfor you will be filled.\nBlessed are you who weep now,\nfor you will laugh.\n\nBlessed are you when men shall hate you, and when they shall exclude and mock you, and throw out your name as evil, for the Son of Man’s sake.\n\n\nRejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven, for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets.\n\n“But woe to you who are rich!\nFor you have received your consolation.\n\nWoe to you, you who are full now,\nfor you will be hungry.\nWoe to you who laugh now,\nfor you will mourn and weep.\n\nWoe,\nwhen\nmen speak well of you,\nfor their fathers did the same thing to the false prophets.\n\n“But I tell you who hear: love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,\n\n\nbless those who curse you, and pray for those who mistreat you.\n\n\nTo him who strikes you on the cheek, offer also the other; and from him who takes away your cloak, don’t withhold your coat also.\n\n\nGive to everyone who asks you, and don’t ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again.\n\n“As you would like people to do to you, do exactly so to them.\n\n\nIf you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.\n\n\nIf you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.\n\n\nIf you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive back as much.\n\n\nBut love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing back; and your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil.\n\n“Therefore be merciful,\neven as your Father is also merciful.\n\nDon’t judge,\nand you won’t be judged.\nDon’t condemn,\nand you won’t be condemned.\nSet free,\nand you will be set free.\n\n“Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will be given to you.\nFor with the same measure you measure it will be measured back to you.”\nHe spoke a parable to them.\n“Can the blind guide the blind? Won’t they both fall into a pit?\n\n\nA disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher.\n\n\nWhy do you see the speck of chaff that is in your brother’s eye, but don’t consider the beam that is in your own eye?\n\n\nOr how can you tell your brother, ‘Brother, let me remove the speck of chaff that is in your eye,’ when you yourself don’t see the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck of chaff that is in your brother’s eye.\n\n\nFor there is no good tree that produces rotten fruit; nor again a rotten tree that produces good fruit.\n\n\nFor each tree is known by its own fruit. For people don’t gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.\n\n\nThe good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings out that which is good, and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings out that which is evil, for out of the abundance of the heart, his mouth speaks.\n\n“Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and don’t do the things which I say?\n\n\nEveryone who comes to me, and hears my words, and does them, I will show you who he is like.\n\n\nHe is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock. When a flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it, because it was founded on the rock.\n\n\nBut he who hears, and doesn’t do, is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.”\n",

      "text": "After he had finished speaking in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum.\nA certain centurion’s servant, who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death.\nWhen he heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and save his servant.\nWhen they came to Jesus, they begged him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy for you to do this for him,\nfor he loves our nation, and he built our synagogue for us.”\nJesus went with them. When he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof.\nTherefore I didn’t even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the word, and my servant will be healed.\nFor I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”\nWhen Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the multitude who followed him,\n“I tell you, I have not found such great faith, no, not in Israel.”\nThose who were sent, returning to the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well.\nSoon afterwards, he went to a city called Nain. Many of his disciples, along with a great multitude, went with him.\nNow when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, one who was dead was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. Many people of the city were with her.\nWhen the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said to her,\n“Don’t cry.”\nHe came near and touched the coffin, and the bearers stood still. He said,\n“Young man, I tell you, arise!”\nHe who was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.\nFear took hold of all, and they glorified God, saying, “A great prophet has arisen among us!” and, “God has visited his people!”\nThis report went out concerning him in the whole of Judea, and in all the surrounding region.\nThe disciples of John told him about all these things.\nJohn, calling to himself two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, “Are you the one who is coming, or should we look for another?”\nWhen the men had come to him, they said, “John the Baptizer has sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you he who comes, or should we look for another?’”\nIn that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and to many who were blind he gave sight.\nJesus answered them,\n“Go and tell John the things which you have seen and heard: that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.\n\n\nBlessed is he who finds no occasion for stumbling in me.”\nWhen John’s messengers had departed, he began to tell the multitudes about John,\n“What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?\n\n\nBut what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts.\n\n\nBut what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.\n\n\nThis is he of whom it is written,\n‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face,\nwho will prepare your way before you.’\n\n“For I tell you, among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptizer, yet he who is least in God’s Kingdom is greater than he.”\nWhen all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they declared God to be just, having been baptized with John’s baptism.\nBut the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God, not being baptized by him themselves.\n\n\n“To what then will I liken the people of this generation? What are they like?\n\n\nThey are like children who sit in the marketplace, and call to one another, saying, ‘We piped to you, and you didn’t dance. We mourned, and you didn’t weep.’\n\n\nFor John the Baptizer came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’\n\n\nThe Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Behold, a gluttonous man, and a drunkard; a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’\n\n\nWisdom is justified by all her children.”\nOne of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him. He entered into the Pharisee’s house, and sat at the table.\nBehold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that he was reclining in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster jar of ointment.\nStanding behind at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them with the hair of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.\nNow when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, “This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him, that she is a sinner.”\nJesus answered him,\n“Simon, I have something to tell you.”\n\nHe said, “Teacher, say on.”\n\n“A certain lender had two debtors. The one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.\n\n\nWhen they couldn’t pay, he forgave them both. Which of them therefore will love him most?”\nSimon answered, “He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most.”\nHe said to him,\n“You have judged correctly.”\nTurning to the woman, he said to Simon,\n“Do you see this woman? I entered into your house, and you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head.\n\n\nYou gave me no kiss, but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.\n\n\nYou didn’t anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.\n\n\nTherefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.”\n\nHe said to her,\n“Your sins are forgiven.”\nThose who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”\nHe said to the woman,\n“Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”\n\n",

      "text": "Soon afterwards, he went about through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good news of God’s Kingdom. With him were the twelve,\nand certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out;\nand Joanna, the wife of Chuzas, Herod’s steward; Susanna; and many others; who served them from their possessions.\nWhen a great multitude came together, and people from every city were coming to him, he spoke by a parable.\n\n“The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell along the road, and it was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky devoured it.\n\n\nOther seed fell on the rock, and as soon as it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture.\n\n\nOther fell amid the thorns, and the thorns grew with it, and choked it.\n\n\nOther fell into the good ground, and grew, and produced one hundred times as much fruit.” As he said these things, he called out,\n“He who has ears to hear, let him hear!”\nThen his disciples asked him, “What does this parable mean?”\nHe said,\n“To you it is given to know the mysteries of God’s Kingdom, but to the rest in parables; that ‘seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.’\n\nNow the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.\n\n\nThose along the road are those who hear, then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.\n\n\nThose on the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root, who believe for a while, then fall away in time of temptation.\n\n\nThat which fell among the thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.\n\n\nThose in the good ground, these are those who with an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it tightly, and produce fruit with perseverance.\n\n“No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a container, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a stand, that those who enter in may see the light.\n\n\nFor nothing is hidden, that will not be revealed; nor anything secret, that will not be known and come to light.\n\n\nBe careful therefore how you hear. For whoever has, to him will be given; and whoever doesn’t have, from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has.”\nHis mother and brothers came to him, and they could not come near him for the crowd.\nSome people told him, “Your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see you.”\nBut he answered them,\n“My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God, and do it.”\nNow on one of those days, he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and he said to them,\n“Let’s go over to the other side of the lake.” So they launched out.\nBut as they sailed, he fell asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water.\nThey came to him, and awoke him, saying, “Master, master, we are dying!” He awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it was calm.\nHe said to them,\n“Where is your faith?” Being afraid they marveled, saying to one another, “Who is this then, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?”\nThey arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.\nWhen Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met him. He wore no clothes, and didn’t live in a house, but in the tombs.\nWhen he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, “What do I have to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torment me!”\nFor Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bonds apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert.\nJesus asked him,\n“What is your name?”\nHe said, “Legion,” for many demons had entered into him.\nThey begged him that he would not command them to go into the abyss.\nNow there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those. He allowed them.\nThe demons came out of the man, and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and were drowned.\nWhen those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.\nPeople went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.\nThose who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed.\nAll the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very much afraid. He entered into the boat, and returned.\nBut the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,\n\n“Return to your house, and declare what great things God has done for you.” He went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.\nWhen Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.\nBehold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus’ feet, and begged him to come into his house,\nfor he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the multitudes pressed against him.\nA woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, and could not be healed by any,\ncame behind him, and touched the fringe of his cloak, and immediately the flow of her blood stopped.\nJesus said,\n“Who touched me?”\nWhen all denied it, Peter and those with him said, “Master, the multitudes press and jostle you, and you say,\n‘Who touched me?’”\nBut Jesus said,\n“Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out of me.”\nWhen the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.\nHe said to her,\n“Daughter, cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”\nWhile he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house came, saying to him, “Your daughter is dead. Don’t trouble the Teacher.”\nBut Jesus hearing it, answered him,\n“Don’t be afraid. Only believe, and she will be healed.”\nWhen he came to the house, he didn’t allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, James, the father of the child, and her mother.\nAll were weeping and mourning her, but he said,\n“Don’t weep. She isn’t dead, but sleeping.”\nThey were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead.\nBut he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, he called, saying,\n“Child, arise!”\nHer spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat.\nHer parents were amazed, but he commanded them to tell no one what had been done.\n",

He welcomed them, and spoke to them of God’s Kingdom, and he cured those who needed healing.\nThe day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said to him, “Send the multitude away, that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and lodge, and get food, for we are here in a deserted place.”\nBut he said to them,\n“You give them something to eat.”\nThey said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should go and buy food for all these people.”\nFor they were about five thousand men.\nHe said to his disciples,\n“Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”\nThey did so, and made them all sit down.\nHe took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he blessed them, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude.\nThey ate, and were all filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over.\nAs he was praying alone, the disciples were with him, and he asked them,\n“Who do the multitudes say that I am?”\nThey answered, “‘John the Baptizer,’ but others say, ‘Elijah,’ and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again.”\nHe said to them,\n“But who do you say that I am?”\nPeter answered, “The Christ of God.”\nBut he warned them, and commanded them to tell this to no one,\nsaying,\n“The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.”\nHe said to all,\n“If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross,\nand follow me.\n\n\nFor whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever will lose his life for my sake, the same will save it.\n\n\nFor what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits his own self?\n\n\nFor whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he comes in his glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels.\n\n\nBut I tell you the truth: There are some of those who stand here, who will in no way taste of death, until they see God’s Kingdom.”\n\nAbout eight days after these sayings, he took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up onto the mountain to pray.\nAs he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became white and dazzling.\nBehold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah,\nwho appeared in glory, and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.\nNow Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him.\nAs they were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah,” not knowing what he said.\nWhile he said these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.\nA voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!”\nWhen the voice came, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.\nOn the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.\nBehold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.\nBehold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams, and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely.\nI begged your disciples to cast it out, and they couldn’t.”\nJesus answered,\n“Faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.”\nWhile he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.\nThey were all astonished at the majesty of God.\nBut while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,\n\n“Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men.”\nBut they didn’t understand this saying. It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.\nThere arose an argument among them about which of them was the greatest.\nJesus, perceiving the reasoning of their hearts, took a little child, and set him by his side,\nand said to them,\n“Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is least among you all, this one will be great.”\nJohn answered, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he doesn’t follow with us.”\nJesus said to him,\n“Don’t forbid him, for he who is not against us is for us.”\nIt came to pass, when the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem,\nand sent messengers before his face.

The door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I can’t get up and give it to you’?\n\n\nI tell you, although he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence, he will get up and give him as many as he needs.\n\n“I tell you, keep asking, and it will be given you. Keep seeking, and you will find. Keep knocking, and it will be opened to you.\n\n\nFor everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.\n\n“Which of you fathers, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, he won’t give him a snake instead of a fish, will he?\n\n\nOr if he asks for an egg, he won’t give him a scorpion, will he?\n\n\nIf you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?”\nHe was casting out a demon, and it was mute. When the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the multitudes marveled.\nBut some of them said, “He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.”\nOthers, testing him, sought from him a sign from heaven.\nBut he, knowing their thoughts, said to them,\n“Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. A house divided against itself falls.\n\n\nIf Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.\n\n\nBut if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore will they be your judges.\n\n\nBut if I by God’s finger cast out demons, then God’s Kingdom has come to you.\n\n“When the strong man, fully armed, guards his own dwelling, his goods are safe.\n\n\nBut when someone stronger attacks him and overcomes him, he takes from him his whole armor in which he trusted, and divides his plunder.\n\n\n“He that is not with me is against me. He who doesn’t gather with me scatters.\n\n\nThe unclean spirit, when he has gone out of the man, passes through dry places, seeking rest, and finding none, he says, ‘I will turn back to my house from which I came out.’\n\n\nWhen he returns, he finds it swept and put in order.\n\n\nThen he goes, and takes seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first.”\nIt came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said to him, “Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts which nursed you!”\nBut he said,\n“On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God, and keep it.”\nWhen the multitudes were gathering together to him, he began to say,\n“This is an evil generation. It seeks after a sign. No sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah, the prophet.\n\n\nFor even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will also the Son of Man be to this generation.\n\n\nThe Queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, one greater than Solomon is here.\n\n\nThe men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, one greater than Jonah is here.\n\n“No one, when he has lit a lamp, puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, that those who come in may see the light.\n\n\nThe lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore when your eye is good, your whole body is also full of light; but when it is evil, your body also is full of darkness.\n\n\nTherefore see whether the light that is in you isn’t darkness.\n\n\nIf therefore your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light.”\nNow as he spoke, a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him. He went in, and sat at the table.\nWhen the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first washed himself before dinner.\nThe Lord said to him,\n“Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.\n\n\nYou foolish ones, didn’t he who made the outside make the inside also?\n\n\nBut give for gifts to the needy those things which are within, and behold, all things will be clean to you.\n\n\nBut woe to you Pharisees!

Not one of them is forgotten by God.\n\n\nBut the very hairs of your head are all counted. Therefore don’t be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows.\n\n“I tell you, everyone who confesses me before men, him will the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God;\n\n\nbut he who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God.\n\n\nEveryone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but those who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.\n\n\nWhen they bring you before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, don’t be anxious how or what you will answer, or what you will say;\n\n\nfor the Holy Spirit will teach you in that same hour what you must say.”\nOne of the multitude said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.”\nBut he said to him,\n“Man, who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you?”\nHe said to them,\n“Beware! Keep yourselves from covetousness, for a man’s life doesn’t consist of the abundance of the things which he possesses.”\nHe spoke a parable to them, saying,\n“The ground of a certain rich man produced abundantly.\n\n\nHe reasoned within himself, saying, ‘What will I do, because I don’t have room to store my crops?’\n\n\nHe said, ‘This is what I will do. I will pull down my barns, and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.\n\n\nI will tell my soul, “Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years. Take your ease, eat, drink, be merry.”’\n\n“But God said to him, ‘You foolish one, tonight your soul is required of you. The things which you have prepared—whose will they be?’\n\n\nSo is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.”\nHe said to his disciples,\n“Therefore I tell you, don’t be anxious for your life, what you will eat, nor yet for your body, what you will wear.\n\n\nLife is more than food, and the body is more than clothing.\n\n\nConsider the ravens: they don’t sow, they don’t reap, they have no warehouse or barn, and God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than birds!\n\n\nWhich of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his height?\n\n\nIf then you aren’t able to do even the least things, why are you anxious about the rest?\n\n\nConsider the lilies, how they grow. They don’t toil, neither do they spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.\n\n\nBut if this is how God clothes the grass in the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith?\n\n\nDon’t seek what you will eat or what you will drink; neither be anxious.\n\n\nFor the nations of the world seek after all of these things, but your Father knows that you need these things.\n\n\nBut seek God’s Kingdom, and all these things will be added to you.\n\n\nDon’t be afraid, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.\n\n\nSell that which you have, and give gifts to the needy. Make for yourselves purses which don’t grow old, a treasure in the heavens that doesn’t fail, where no thief approaches, neither moth destroys.\n\n\nFor where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\n\n\n“Let your waist be dressed and your lamps burning.\n\n\nBe like men watching for their lord, when he returns from the marriage feast; that, when he comes and knocks, they may immediately open to him.\n\n\nBlessed are those servants, whom the lord will find watching when he comes. Most certainly I tell you, that he will dress himself, and make them recline, and will come and serve them.\n\n\nThey will be blessed if he comes in the second or third watch, and finds them so.\n\n\nBut know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and not allowed his house to be broken into.\n\n\nTherefore be ready also, for the Son of Man is coming in an hour that you don’t expect him.”\nPeter said to him, “Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everybody?”\nThe Lord said,\n“Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the right times?\n\n\nBlessed is that servant whom his lord will find doing so when he comes.\n\n\nTruly I tell you, that he will set him over all that he has.\n\n\nBut if that servant says in his heart, ‘My lord delays his coming,’ and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken,\n\n\nthen the lord of that servant will come in a day when he isn’t expecting him, and in an hour that he doesn’t know, and will cut him in two, and place his portion with the unfaithful.\n\n\nThat servant, who knew his lord’s will, and didn’t prepare, nor do what he wanted, will be beaten with many stripes,\n\n\nbut he who didn’t know, and did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few stripes. To whomever much is given, of him will much be required; and to whom much was entrusted, of him more will be asked.\n\n\n“I came to throw fire on the earth. I wish it were already kindled.\n\n\nBut I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!\n\n\nDo you think that I have come to give peace in the earth? I tell you, no, but rather division.\n\n\nFor from now on, there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.\n\n\nThey will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.”\n\n\nHe said to the multitudes also, “When you see a cloud rising from the west, immediately you say, ‘A shower is coming,’ and so it happens.\n\n\nWhen a south wind blows, you say, ‘There will be a scorching heat,’ and it happens.\n\n\nYou hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky, but how is it that you don’t interpret this time?\n\n\nWhy don’t you judge for yourselves what is right?\n\n\nFor when you are going with your adversary before the magistrate, try diligently on the way to be released from him, lest perhaps he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.\n\n\nI tell you, you will by no means get out of there, until you have paid the very last penny.”\n",

An accusation was made to him that this man was wasting his possessions.\n\n\nHe called him, and said to him, ‘What is this that I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management, for you can no longer be manager.’\n\n\n“The manager said within himself, ‘What will I do, seeing that my lord is taking away the management position from me? I don’t have strength to dig. I am ashamed to beg.\n\n\nI know what I will do, so that when I am removed from management, they may receive me into their houses.’\n\n\nCalling each one of his lord’s debtors to him, he said to the first, ‘How much do you owe to my lord?’\n\n\nHe said, ‘A hundred batos of oil.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.’\n\n\nThen he said to another, ‘How much do you owe?’ He said, ‘A hundred cors of wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, and write eighty.’\n\n“His lord commended the dishonest manager because he had done wisely, for the children of this world are, in their own generation, wiser than the children of the light.\n\n\nI tell you, make for yourselves friends by means of unrighteous mammon, so that when you fail, they may receive you into the eternal tents.\n\n\nHe who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much. He who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much.\n\n\nIf therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?\n\n\nIf you have not been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give you that which is your own?\n\n\nNo servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. You aren’t able to serve God and Mammon.”\nThe Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they scoffed at him.\nHe said to them,\n“You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts. For that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.\n\n\nThe law and the prophets were until John. From that time the Good News of God’s Kingdom is preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.\n\n\nBut it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to fall.\n\n\nEveryone who divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery. He who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery.\n\n\n“Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, living in luxury every day.\n\n\nA certain beggar, named Lazarus, was taken to his gate, full of sores,\n\n\nand desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table. Yes, even the dogs came and licked his sores.\n\n\nThe beggar died, and he was carried away by the angels to Abraham’s bosom. The rich man also died, and was buried.\n\n\nIn Hades, he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham far off, and Lazarus at his bosom.\n\n\nHe cried and said, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue! For I am in anguish in this flame.’\n\n“But Abraham said, ‘Son, remember that you, in your lifetime, received your good things, and Lazarus, in the same way, bad things. But here he is now comforted, and you are in anguish.\n\n\nBesides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that those who want to pass from here to you are not able, and that no one may cross over from there to us.’\n\n“He said, ‘I ask you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father’s house;\n\n\nfor I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, so they won’t also come into this place of torment.’\n\n“But Abraham said to him, ‘They have Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them.’\n\n“He said, ‘No, father Abraham, but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.’\n\n“He said to him, ‘If they don’t listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if one rises from the dead.’”\n",

Follow him into the house which he enters.\n\n\nTell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’\n\n\nHe will show you a large, furnished upper room. Make preparations there.”\nThey went, found things as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover.\nWhen the hour had come, he sat down with the twelve apostles.\nHe said to them,\n“I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,\n\n\nfor I tell you, I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in God’s Kingdom.”\nHe received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said,\n“Take this, and share it among yourselves,\n\n\nfor I tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until God’s Kingdom comes.”\nHe took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke, and gave it to them, saying,\n“This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me.”\nLikewise, he took the cup after supper, saying,\n“This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.\n\n\nBut behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.\n\n\nThe Son of Man indeed goes, as it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!”\nThey began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing.\nThere arose also a contention among them, which of them was considered to be greatest.\nHe said to them,\n“The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called ‘benefactors.’\n\n\nBut not so with you. But one who is the greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves.\n\n\nFor who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves?

You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”\nThe Lord said,\n“Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have all of you, that he might sift you as wheat,\n\n\nbut I prayed for you, that your faith wouldn’t fail.

Then Peter remembered the Lord’s word, how he said to him,\n“Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times.”\nHe went out, and wept bitterly.\nThe men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him.\nHaving blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, “Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?”\nThey spoke many other things against him, insulting him.\nAs soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people were gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away into their council, saying,\n“If you are the Christ, tell us.”\nBut he said to them,\n“If I tell you, you won’t believe,\n\n\nand if I ask, you will in no way answer me or let me go.\n\n\nFrom now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”\nThey all said, “Are you then the Son of God?”\nHe said to them,\n“You say it, because I am.”\nThey said, “Why do we need any more witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth!”\n",

He hoped to see some miracle done by him.\nHe questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers.\nThe chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.\nHerod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate.\nHerod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other.\nPilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,\nand said to them, “You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and behold, having examined him before you, I found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him.\nNeither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.\nI will therefore chastise him and release him.”\nNow he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.\nBut they all cried out together, saying, “Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!”—\none who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.\nThen Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus,\nbut they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!”\nHe said to them the third time, “Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him.”\nBut they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed.\nPilate decreed that what they asked for should be done.\nHe released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will.\nWhen they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it after Jesus.\nA great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him.\nBut Jesus, turning to them, said,\n“Daughters of Jerusalem, don’t weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.\n\n\nFor behold, the days are coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’\n\n\nThen they will begin to tell the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and tell the hills, ‘Cover us.’\n\nFor if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?”\nThere were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death.\nWhen they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.\nJesus said,\n“Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.”\nDividing his garments among them, they cast lots.\nThe people stood watching. The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!”\nThe soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,\nand saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!”\nAn inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: “THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.”\nOne of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying, “If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!”\nBut the other answered, and rebuking him said, “Don’t you even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?\nAnd we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.”\nHe said to Jesus, “Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.”\nJesus said to him,\n“Assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.”\nIt was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.\nThe sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two.\nJesus, crying with a loud voice, said,\n“Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!” Having said this, he breathed his last.\nWhen the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, “Certainly this was a righteous man.”\nAll the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things that were done, returned home beating their breasts.\nAll his acquaintances, and the women who followed with him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.\nBehold, a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man\n(he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also waiting for God’s Kingdom:\nthis man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body.\nHe took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid.\nIt was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near.\nThe women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid.\nThey returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.\n",

      "text": "But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they and some others came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.\nThey found the stone rolled away from the tomb.\nThey entered in, and didn’t find the Lord Jesus’ body.\nWhile they were greatly perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling clothing.\nBecoming terrified, they bowed their faces down to the earth.\nThey said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead?\nHe isn’t here, but is risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee,\nsaying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again?”\nThey remembered his words,\nreturned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.\nNow they were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James. The other women with them told these things to the apostles.\nThese words seemed to them to be nonsense, and they didn’t believe them.\nBut Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he departed to his home, wondering what had happened.\nBehold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia from Jerusalem.\nThey talked with each other about all of these things which had happened.\nWhile they talked and questioned together, Jesus himself came near, and went with them.\nBut their eyes were kept from recognizing him.\nHe said to them,\n“What are you talking about as you walk, and are sad?”\nOne of them, named Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who doesn’t know the things which have happened there in these days?”\nHe said to them,\n“What things?”\nThey said to him, “The things concerning Jesus, the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;\nand how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.\nBut we were hoping that it was he who would redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.\nAlso, certain women of our company amazed us, having arrived early at the tomb;\nand when they didn’t find his body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.\nSome of us went to the tomb, and found it just like the women had said, but they didn’t see him.”\nHe said to them,\n“Foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!\n\n\nDidn’t the Christ have to suffer these things and to enter into his glory?”\nBeginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.\nThey came near to the village, where they were going, and he acted like he would go further.\nThey urged him, saying, “Stay with us, for it is almost evening, and the day is almost over.”\nHe went in to stay with them.\nWhen he had sat down at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks. Breaking it, he gave it to them.\nTheir eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he vanished out of their sight.\nThey said to one another, “Weren’t our hearts burning within us, while he spoke to us along the way, and while he opened the Scriptures to us?”\nThey rose up that very hour, returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them,\nsaying, “The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!”\nThey related the things that happened along the way, and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.\nAs they said these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them,\n“Peace be to you.”\nBut they were terrified and filled with fear, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.\nHe said to them,\n“Why are you troubled? Why do doubts arise in your hearts?\n\n\nSee my hands and my feet, that it is truly me. Touch me and see, for a spirit doesn’t have flesh and bones, as you see that I have.”\nWhen he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.\nWhile they still didn’t believe for joy, and wondered, he said to them,\n“Do you have anything here to eat?”\nThey gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.\nHe took them, and ate in front of them.\nHe said to them,\n“This is what I told you, while I was still with you, that all things which are written in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me must be fulfilled.”\nThen he opened their minds, that they might understand the Scriptures.\nHe said to them,\n“Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,\n\n\nand that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.\n\n\nYou are witnesses of these things.\n\n\nBehold, I send out the promise of my Father on you. But wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high.”\n\nHe led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.\nWhile he blessed them, he withdrew from them, and was carried up into heaven.\nThey worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,\nand were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.\n",
