To save a life, or to kill?” But they were silent.\nWhen he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man,\n“Stretch out your hand.”\n He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other.\nThe Pharisees went out, and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.\nJesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea,\nfrom Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him.\nHe spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they wouldn’t press on him.\nFor he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him.\nThe unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, “You are the Son of God!”\nHe sternly warned them that they should not make him known.\nHe went up into the mountain, and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to him.\nHe appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach,\nand to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons:\nSimon (to whom he gave the name Peter);\nJames the son of Zebedee; and John, the brother of James, (whom he called Boanerges, which means, Sons of Thunder);\nAndrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot;\nand Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.\nThen he came into a house.\nThe multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.\nWhen his friends heard it, they went out to seize him: for they said, “He is insane.”\nThe scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, “He has Beelzebul,” and, “By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons.”\nHe summoned them, and said to them in parables,\n“How can Satan cast out Satan?\n\n\nIf a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.\n\n\nIf a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.\n\n\nIf Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he can’t stand, but has an end.\n\n\nBut no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder, unless he first binds the strong man; and then he will plunder his house.\n\n\nMost certainly I tell you, all sins of the descendants of man will be forgiven, including their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme;\n\n\nbut whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation.”\n\n—because they said, “He has an unclean spirit.”\nHis mother and his brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him.\nA multitude was sitting around him, and they told him, “Behold, your mother, your brothers, and your sisters are outside looking for you.”\nHe answered them,\n“Who are my mother and my brothers?”\nLooking around at those who sat around him, he said,\n“Behold, my mother and my brothers!\n\n\nFor whoever does the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.”\n",

With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you who hear.\n\n\nFor whoever has, to him will more be given, and he who doesn’t have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.”\nHe said,\n“God’s Kingdom is as if a man should cast seed on the earth,\n\n\nand should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, though he doesn’t know how.\n\n\nFor the earth bears fruit: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.\n\n\nBut when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.”\nHe said,\n“How will we liken God’s Kingdom? Or with what parable will we illustrate it?\n\n\nIt’s like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth,\n\n\nyet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow.”\nWith many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.\nWithout a parable he didn’t speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.\nOn that day, when evening had come, he said to them,\n“Let’s go over to the other side.”\nLeaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also with him.\nA big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled.\nHe himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and told him, “Teacher, don’t you care that we are dying?”\nHe awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea,\n“Peace! Be still!” The wind ceased, and there was a great calm.\nHe said to them,\n“Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?”\nThey were greatly afraid, and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”\n",

He has risen from the dead.”\nFor Herod himself had sent out and arrested John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, for he had married her.\nFor John said to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.”\nHerodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him, but she couldn’t,\nfor Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he did many things, and he heard him gladly.\nThen a convenient day came, that Herod on his birthday made a supper for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief men of Galilee.\nWhen the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those sitting with him. The king said to the young lady, “Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you.”\nHe swore to her, “Whatever you shall ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.”\nShe went out, and said to her mother, “What shall I ask?”\nShe said, “The head of John the Baptizer.”\nShe came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, “I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter.”\nThe king was exceedingly sorry, but for the sake of his oaths, and of his dinner guests, he didn’t wish to refuse her.\nImmediately the king sent out a soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring John’s head, and he went and beheaded him in the prison,\nand brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the young lady; and the young lady gave it to her mother.\nWhen his disciples heard this, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.\nThe apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus, and they told him all things, whatever they had done, and whatever they had taught.\nHe said to them,\n“You come apart into a deserted place, and rest awhile.” For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.\nThey went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves.\nThey saw them going, and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They arrived before them and came together to him.\nJesus came out, saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.\nWhen it was late in the day, his disciples came to him, and said, “This place is deserted, and it is late in the day.\nSend them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages, and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat.”\nBut he answered them,\n“You give them something to eat.”\nThey asked him, “Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give them something to eat?”\nHe said to them,\n“How many loaves do you have? Go see.”\nWhen they knew, they said, “Five, and two fish.”\nHe commanded them that everyone should sit down in groups on the green grass.\nThey sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties.\nHe took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and he gave to his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish among them all.\nThey all ate, and were filled.\nThey took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and also of the fish.\nThose who ate the loaves were five thousand men.\nImmediately he made his disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself sent the multitude away.\nAfter he had taken leave of them, he went up the mountain to pray.\nWhen evening had come, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he was alone on the land.\nSeeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea,\n and he would have passed by them,\nbut they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;\nfor they all saw him, and were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them, and said to them,\n“Cheer up! It is I!\nDon’t be afraid.”\nHe got into the boat with them; and the wind ceased, and they were very amazed among themselves, and marveled;\nfor they hadn’t understood about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.\nWhen they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.\nWhen they had come out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him,\nand ran around that whole region, and began to bring those who were sick, on their mats, to where they heard he was.\nWherever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might just touch the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched him were made well.\n",

Come, let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’\n\n\nThey took him, killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.\n\n\nWhat therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.\n\n\nHaven’t you even read this Scripture:\n‘The stone which the builders rejected,\nthe same was made the head of the corner.\n\nThis was from the Lord,\nit is marvelous in our eyes’?”\nThey tried to seize him, but they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them. They left him, and went away.\nThey sent some of the Pharisees and the Herodians to him, that they might trap him with words.\nWhen they had come, they asked him, “Teacher, we know that you are honest, and don’t defer to anyone; for you aren’t partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?\nShall we give, or shall we not give?”\nBut he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them,\n“Why do you test me? Bring me a denarius, that I may see it.”\nThey brought it.\nHe said to them,\n“Whose is this image and inscription?”\nThey said to him, “Caesar’s.”\nJesus answered them,\n“Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”\nThey marveled greatly at him.\nThere came to him Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection. They asked him, saying,\n“Teacher, Moses wrote to us, ‘If a man’s brother dies, and leaves a wife behind him, and leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up offspring for his brother.’\nThere were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and dying left no offspring.\nThe second took her, and died, leaving no children behind him. The third likewise;\nand the seven took her and left no children. Last of all the woman also died.\nIn the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as a wife.”\nJesus answered them,\n“Isn’t this because you are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God?\n\n\nFor when they will rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.\n\n\nBut about the dead, that they are raised; haven’t you read in the book of Moses, about the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?\n\nHe is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are therefore badly mistaken.”\nOne of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together. Knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, “Which commandment is the greatest of all?”\nJesus answered,\n“The greatest is, ‘Hear, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one:\n\n\nyou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’\nThis is the first commandment.\n\n\nThe second is like this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’\nThere is no other commandment greater than these.”\nThe scribe said to him, “Truly, teacher, you have said well that he is one, and there is none other but he,\nand to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”\nWhen Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him,\n“You are not far from God’s Kingdom.”\nNo one dared ask him any question after that.\nJesus responded, as he taught in the temple,\n“How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?\n\n\nFor David himself said in the Holy Spirit,\n‘The Lord said to my Lord,\n“Sit at my right hand,\nuntil I make your enemies the footstool of your feet.”’\n\nTherefore David himself calls him Lord, so how can he be his son?”\n\nThe common people heard him gladly.\nIn his teaching he said to them,\n“Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and to get greetings in the marketplaces,\n\n\nand the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts:\n\n\nthose who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation.”\nJesus sat down opposite the treasury, and saw how the multitude cast money into the treasury. Many who were rich cast in much.\nA poor widow came, and she cast in two small brass coins, which equal a quadrans coin.\nHe called his disciples to himself, and said to them,\n“Most certainly I tell you, this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury,\n\n\nfor they all gave out of their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, gave all that she had to live on.”\n",

There will not be left here one stone on another, which will not be thrown down.”\nAs he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,\n“Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign that these things are all about to be fulfilled?”\nJesus, answering, began to tell them,\n“Be careful that no one leads you astray.\n\n\nFor many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he!’\nand will lead many astray.\n\n“When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don’t be troubled. For those must happen, but the end is not yet.\n\n\nFor nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places. There will be famines and troubles. These things are the beginning of birth pains.\n\n\nBut watch yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils. You will be beaten in synagogues. You will stand before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them.\n\n\nThe Good News must first be preached to all the nations.\n\n\nWhen they lead you away and deliver you up, don’t be anxious beforehand, or premeditate what you will say, but say whatever will be given you in that hour. For it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.\n\n“Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.\n\n\nYou will be hated by all men for my name’s sake, but he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.\n\n\nBut when you see the abomination of desolation,\nspoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains,\n\n\nand let him who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter in, to take anything out of his house.\n\n\nLet him who is in the field not return back to take his cloak.\n\n\nBut woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse babies in those days!\n\n\nPray that your flight won’t be in the winter.\n\n\nFor in those days there will be oppression, such as there has not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will be.\n\n\nUnless the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved; but for the sake of the chosen ones, whom he picked out, he shortened the days.\n\n\nThen if anyone tells you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or, ‘Look, there!’ don’t believe it.\n\n\nFor there will arise false christs and false prophets, and will show signs and wonders, that they may lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.\n\n\nBut you watch.\n“Behold, I have told you all things beforehand.\n\n\nBut in those days, after that oppression, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light,\n\n\nthe stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.\n\nThen they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.\n\n\nThen he will send out his angels, and will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the sky.\n\n“Now from the fig tree, learn this parable. When the branch has now become tender, and produces its leaves, you know that the summer is near;\n\n\neven so you also, when you see these things coming to pass, know that it is near, at the doors.\n\n\nMost certainly I say to you, this generation\nwill not pass away until all these things happen.\n\n\nHeaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.\n\n\nBut of that day or that hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.\n\n\nWatch, keep alert, and pray; for you don’t know when the time is.\n\n\n“It is like a man, traveling to another country, having left his house, and given authority to his servants, and to each one his work, and also commanded the doorkeeper to keep watch.\n\n\nWatch therefore, for you don’t know when the lord of the house is coming, whether at evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning;\n\n\nlest coming suddenly he might find you sleeping.\n\n\nWhat I tell you, I tell all: Watch.”\n",

      "text": "It was now two days before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread, and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might seize him by deception, and kill him.\nFor they said, “Not during the feast, because there might be a riot among the people.”\nWhile he was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard—very costly. She broke the jar, and poured it over his head.\nBut there were some who were indignant among themselves, saying, “Why has this ointment been wasted?\nFor this might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii,\n and given to the poor.” They grumbled against her.\nBut Jesus said,\n“Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work for me.\n\n\nFor you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want to, you can do them good; but you will not always have me.\n\n\nShe has done what she could. She has anointed my body beforehand for the burying.\n\n\nMost certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News may be preached throughout the whole world, that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her.”\nJudas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them.\nThey, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money. He sought how he might conveniently deliver him.\nOn the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover, his disciples asked him, “Where do you want us to go and prepare that you may eat the Passover?”\nHe sent two of his disciples, and said to them,\n“Go into the city, and there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him,\n\n\nand wherever he enters in, tell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says, “Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’\n\n\nHe will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready. Get ready for us there.”\nHis disciples went out, and came into the city, and found things as he had said to them, and they prepared the Passover.\nWhen it was evening he came with the twelve.\nAs they sat and were eating, Jesus said,\n“Most certainly I tell you, one of you will betray me—he who eats with me.”\nThey began to be sorrowful, and to ask him one by one, “Surely not I?” And another said, “Surely not I?”\nHe answered them,\n“It is one of the twelve, he who dips with me in the dish.\n\n\nFor the Son of Man goes, even as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born.”\nAs they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had blessed, he broke it, and gave to them, and said,\n“Take, eat. This is my body.”\nHe took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them. They all drank of it.\nHe said to them,\n“This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many.\n\n\nMost certainly I tell you, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it anew in God’s Kingdom.”\nWhen they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.\nJesus said to them,\n“All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’\n\nHowever, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.”\n\nBut Peter said to him, “Although all will be offended, yet I will not.”\nJesus said to him,\n“Most certainly I tell you, that you today, even this night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.”\n\nBut he spoke all the more, “If I must die with you, I will not deny you.” They all said the same thing.\nThey came to a place which was named Gethsemane. He said to his disciples,\n“Sit here, while I pray.”\nHe took with him Peter, James, and John, and began to be greatly troubled and distressed.\nHe said to them,\n“My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch.”\nHe went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him.\nHe said,\n“Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Please remove this cup from me. However, not what I desire, but what you desire.”\n\nHe came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter,\n“Simon, are you sleeping? Couldn’t you watch one hour?\n\n\nWatch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”\nAgain he went away, and prayed, saying the same words.\nAgain he returned, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they didn’t know what to answer him.\nHe came the third time, and said to them,\n“Sleep on now, and take your rest. It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.\n\n\nArise, let us be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.”\n\nImmediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came—and with him a multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.\nNow he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, “Whomever I will kiss, that is he. Seize him, and lead him away safely.”\nWhen he had come, immediately he came to him, and said, “Rabbi! Rabbi!” and kissed him.\nThey laid their hands on him, and seized him.\nBut a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.\nJesus answered them,\n“Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me?\n\n\nI was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you didn’t arrest me. But this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.”\nThey all left him, and fled.\nA certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown around himself over his naked body. The young men grabbed him,\nbut he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.\nThey led Jesus away to the high priest. All the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes came together with him.\nPeter had followed him from a distance, until he came into the court of the high priest. He was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire.\nNow the chief priests and the whole council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to death, and found none.\nFor many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony didn’t agree with each other.\nSome stood up, and gave false testimony against him, saying,\n“We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.’”\nEven so, their testimony did not agree.\nThe high priest stood up in the middle, and asked Jesus, “Have you no answer?

Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back.\nEntering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were amazed.\nHe said to them, “Don’t be amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen. He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him!\nBut go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he said to you.’”\nThey went out, and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid.\n\nNow when he had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.\nShe went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.\nWhen they heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, they disbelieved.\nAfter these things he was revealed in another form to two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country.\nThey went away and told it to the rest. They didn’t believe them, either.\nAfterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didn’t believe those who had seen him after he had risen.\nHe said to them,\n“Go into all the world, and preach the Good News to the whole creation.\n\n\nHe who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who disbelieves will be condemned.\n\n\nThese signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new languages;\n\n\nthey will take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will in no way hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.”\nSo then the Lord, after he had spoken to them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.\nThey went out, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs that followed. Amen.\n",
