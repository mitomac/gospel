Opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.\nBeing warned in a dream that they shouldn’t return to Herod, they went back to their own country another way.\nNow when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.”\nHe arose and took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt,\nand was there until the death of Herod; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt I called my son.”\nThen Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and sent out, and killed all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding countryside, from two years old and under, according to the exact time which he had learned from the wise men.\nThen that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying,\n“A voice was heard in Ramah,\nlamentation, weeping and great mourning,\nRachel weeping for her children;\nshe wouldn’t be comforted,\nbecause they are no more.”\nBut when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,\n“Arise and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who sought the young child’s life are dead.”\nHe arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.\nBut when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, he was afraid to go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of Galilee,\nand came and lived in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets: “He will be called a Nazarene.”\n",

He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick;\nthat it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, “He took our infirmities, and bore our diseases.”\nNow when Jesus saw great multitudes around him, he gave the order to depart to the other side.\nA scribe came, and said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”\nJesus said to him,\n“The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”\nAnother of his disciples said to him, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.”\nBut Jesus said to him,\n“Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.”\nWhen he got into a boat, his disciples followed him.\nBehold, a violent storm came up on the sea, so much that the boat was covered with the waves, but he was asleep.\nThey came to him, and woke him up, saying, “Save us, Lord! We are dying!”\nHe said to them,\n“Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?”\n Then he got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm.\nThe men marveled, saying, “What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”\nWhen he came to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes,\n two people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass that way.\nBehold, they cried out, saying, “What do we have to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?”\nNow there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them.\nThe demons begged him, saying, “If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs.”\nHe said to them,\n“Go!”\nThey came out, and went into the herd of pigs: and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea, and died in the water.\nThose who fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with demons.\nBehold, all the city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged that he would depart from their borders.\n",

A reed shaken by the wind?\n\n\nBut what did you go out to see? A man in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings’ houses.\n\n\nBut why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.\n\n\nFor this is he, of whom it is written, ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.’\n\nMost certainly I tell you, among those who are born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptizer; yet he who is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he.\n\n\nFrom the days of John the Baptizer until now, the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.\n\nFor all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.\n\n\nIf you are willing to receive it, this is Elijah, who is to come.\n\n\nHe who has ears to hear, let him hear.\n\n“But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, who call to their companions\n\n\nand say, ‘We played the flute for you, and you didn’t dance. We mourned for you, and you didn’t lament.’\n\n\nFor John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’\n\n\nThe Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom is justified by her children.”\nThen he began to denounce the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they didn’t repent.\n\n“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.\n\n\nBut I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.\n\n\nYou, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, you will go down to Hades.\n\nFor if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in you, it would have remained until today.\n\n\nBut I tell you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom, on the day of judgment, than for you.”\nAt that time, Jesus answered,\n“I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you hid these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to infants.\n\n\nYes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.\n\n\nAll things have been delivered to me by my Father.

His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.\nBut the Pharisees, when they saw it, said to him, “Behold, your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.”\nBut he said to them,\n“Haven’t you read what David did, when he was hungry, and those who were with him;\n\n\nhow he entered into God’s house, and ate the show bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for those who were with him, but only for the priests?\n\nOr have you not read in the law, that on the Sabbath day, the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are guiltless?\n\n\nBut I tell you that one greater than the temple is here.\n\n\nBut if you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’\nyou wouldn’t have condemned the guiltless.\n\n\nFor the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”\nHe departed there, and went into their synagogue.\nAnd behold there was a man with a withered hand. They asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day?” that they might accuse him.\nHe said to them,\n“What man is there among you, who has one sheep, and if this one falls into a pit on the Sabbath day, won’t he grab on to it, and lift it out?\n\n\nOf how much more value then is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day.”\nThen he told the man,\n“Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out; and it was restored whole, just like the other.\nBut the Pharisees went out, and conspired against him, how they might destroy him.\nJesus, perceiving that, withdrew from there. Great multitudes followed him; and he healed them all,\nand commanded them that they should not make him known:\nthat it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,\n“Behold, my servant whom I have chosen;\nmy beloved in whom my soul is well pleased:\nI will put my Spirit on him.\nHe will proclaim justice to the nations.\nHe will not strive, nor shout;\nneither will anyone hear his voice in the streets.\nHe won’t break a bruised reed.\nHe won’t quench a smoking flax,\nuntil he leads justice to victory.\nIn his name, the nations will hope.”\nThen one possessed by a demon, blind and mute, was brought to him and he healed him, so that the blind and mute man both spoke and saw.\nAll the multitudes were amazed, and said, “Can this be the son of David?”\nBut when the Pharisees heard it, they said, “This man does not cast out demons, except by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.”\nKnowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them,\n“Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.\n\n\nIf Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?\n\n\nIf I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.\n\n\nBut if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then God’s Kingdom has come upon you.\n\n\nOr how can one enter into the house of the strong man, and plunder his goods, unless he first bind the strong man? Then he will plunder his house.\n\n“He who is not with me is against me, and he who doesn’t gather with me, scatters.\n\n\nTherefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men.\n\n\nWhoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age, nor in that which is to come.\n\n“Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt; for the tree is known by its fruit.\n\n\nYou offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.\n\n\nThe good man out of his good treasure brings out good things, and the evil man out of his evil treasure\nbrings out evil things.\n\n\nI tell you that every idle word that men speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment.\n\n\nFor by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”\nThen certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.”\nBut he answered them,\n“An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, but no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet.\n\n\nFor as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.\n\n\nThe men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, someone greater than Jonah is here.\n\n\nThe queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, someone greater than Solomon is here.\n\n\nWhen an unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he passes through waterless places, seeking rest, and doesn’t find it.\n\n\nThen he says, ‘I will return into my house from which I came out,’ and when he has come back, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order.\n\n\nThen he goes, and takes with himself seven other spirits more evil than he is, and they enter in and dwell there. The last state of that man becomes worse than the first. Even so will it be also to this evil generation.”\nWhile he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him.\nOne said to him, “Behold, your mother and your brothers stand outside, seeking to speak to you.”\nBut he answered him who spoke to him,\n“Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?”\nHe stretched out his hand towards his disciples, and said,\n“Behold, my mother and my brothers!\n\n\nFor whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.”\n",

      "text": "On that day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the seaside.\nGreat multitudes gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat, and sat, and all the multitude stood on the beach.\nHe spoke to them many things in parables, saying,\n“Behold, a farmer went out to sow.\n\n\nAs he sowed, some seeds fell by the roadside, and the birds came and devoured them.\n\n\nOthers fell on rocky ground, where they didn’t have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, because they had no depth of earth.\n\n\nWhen the sun had risen, they were scorched. Because they had no root, they withered away.\n\n\nOthers fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked them.\n\n\nOthers fell on good soil, and yielded fruit: some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.\n\n\nHe who has ears to hear, let him hear.”\nThe disciples came, and said to him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?”\nHe answered them,\n“To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, but it is not given to them.\n\n\nFor whoever has, to him will be given, and he will have abundance, but whoever doesn’t have, from him will be taken away even that which he has.\n\n\nTherefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they don’t see, and hearing, they don’t hear, neither do they understand.\n\n\nIn them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says,\n\n‘By hearing you will hear,\nand will in no way understand;\nSeeing you will see,\nand will in no way perceive:\n\nfor this people’s heart has grown callous,\ntheir ears are dull of hearing,\nthey have closed their eyes;\nor else perhaps they might perceive with their eyes,\nhear with their ears,\nunderstand with their heart,\nand would turn again;\nand I would heal them.’\n\n“But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.\n\n\nFor most certainly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see, and didn’t see them; and to hear the things which you hear, and didn’t hear them.\n\n“Hear, then, the parable of the farmer.\n\n\nWhen anyone hears the word of the Kingdom, and doesn’t understand it, the evil one comes, and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown by the roadside.\n\n\nWhat was sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word, and immediately with joy receives it;\n\n\nyet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles.\n\n\nWhat was sown among the thorns, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.\n\n\nWhat was sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the word, and understands it, who most certainly bears fruit, and produces, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.”\nHe set another parable before them, saying,\n“The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field,\n\n\nbut while people slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel weeds\nalso among the wheat, and went away.\n\n\nBut when the blade sprang up and produced fruit, then the darnel weeds appeared also.\n\n\nThe servants of the householder came and said to him, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where did these darnel weeds come from?’\n\n“He said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’\n“The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and gather them up?’\n\n\n“But he said, ‘No, lest perhaps while you gather up the darnel weeds, you root up the wheat with them.\n\n\nLet both grow together until the harvest, and in the harvest time I will tell the reapers, “First, gather up the darnel weeds, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.”’”\nHe set another parable before them, saying,\n“The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field;\n\n\nwhich indeed is smaller than all seeds. But when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches.”\nHe spoke another parable to them.\n“The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast, which a woman took, and hid in three measures\nof meal, until it was all leavened.”\nJesus spoke all these things in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable, he didn’t speak to them,\nthat it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,\n“I will open my mouth in parables;\nI will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.”\nThen Jesus sent the multitudes away, and went into the house. His disciples came to him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the darnel weeds of the field.”\nHe answered them,\n“He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,\n\n\nthe field is the world; and the good seed, these are the children of the Kingdom; and the darnel weeds are the children of the evil one.\n\n\nThe enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.\n\n\nAs therefore the darnel weeds are gathered up and burned with fire; so will it be at the end of this age.\n\n\nThe Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his Kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and those who do iniquity,\n\n\nand will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth.\n\n\nThen the righteous will shine like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\n\n“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like treasure hidden in the field, which a man found, and hid. In his joy, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.\n\n“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls,\n\n\nwho having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.\n\n“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet, that was cast into the sea, and gathered some fish of every kind,\n\n\nwhich, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach. They sat down, and gathered the good into containers, but the bad they threw away.\n\n\nSo will it be in the end of the world. The angels will come and separate the wicked from among the righteous,\n\n\nand will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.”\nJesus said to them,\n“Have you understood all these things?”\n\nThey answered him, “Yes, Lord.”\nHe said to them,\n“Therefore every scribe who has been made a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder, who brings out of his treasure new and old things.”\nWhen Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there.\nComing into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom, and these mighty works?\nIsn’t this the carpenter’s son?

Where then did this man get all of these things?”\nThey were offended by him.\nBut Jesus said to them,\n“A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and in his own house.”\nHe didn’t do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.\n",

He had compassion on them, and healed their sick.\nWhen evening had come, his disciples came to him, saying, “This place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.”\nBut Jesus said to them,\n“They don’t need to go away. You give them something to eat.”\nThey told him, “We only have here five loaves and two fish.”\nHe said,\n“Bring them here to me.”\nHe commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes.\nThey all ate, and were filled.

For they don’t wash their hands when they eat bread.”\nHe answered them,\n“Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?\n\n\nFor God commanded, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’\nand, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’\n\nBut you say, ‘Whoever may tell his father or his mother, “Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,”\n\n\nhe shall not honor his father or mother.’ You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition.\n\n\nYou hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,\n\n‘These people draw near to me with their mouth,\nand honor me with their lips;\nbut their heart is far from me.\n\nAnd in vain do they worship me,\nteaching as doctrine rules made by men.’”\nHe summoned the multitude, and said to them,\n“Hear, and understand.\n\n\nThat which enters into the mouth doesn’t defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.”\nThen the disciples came, and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?”\nBut he answered,\n“Every plant which my heavenly Father didn’t plant will be uprooted.\n\n\nLeave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit.”\nPeter answered him, “Explain the parable to us.”\nSo Jesus said,\n“Do you also still not understand?\n\n\nDon’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the body?\n\n\nBut the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man.\n\n\nFor out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies.\n\n\nThese are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn’t defile the man.”\nJesus went out from there, and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon.\nBehold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon!”\nBut he answered her not a word.\nHis disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away; for she cries after us.”\nBut he answered,\n“I wasn’t sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”\nBut she came and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, help me.”\nBut he answered,\n“It is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”\nBut she said, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.”\nThen Jesus answered her,\n“Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire.” And her daughter was healed from that hour.\nJesus departed from there, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there.\nGreat multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them,\nso that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking, the injured healed, the lame walking, and the blind seeing—and they glorified the God of Israel.\nJesus summoned his disciples and said,\n“I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way.”\n\nThe disciples said to him, “Where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?”\nJesus said to them,\n“How many loaves do you have?”\nThey said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”\nHe commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;\nand he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.\nThey all ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.\nThose who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.\nThen he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.\n",

For it must be that the occasions come, but woe to that person through whom the occasion comes!\n\n\nIf your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire.\n\n\nIf your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna\nof fire.\n\n\nSee that you don’t despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.\n\n\nFor the Son of Man came to save that which was lost.\n\n“What do you think? If a man has one hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, doesn’t he leave the ninety-nine, go to the mountains, and seek that which has gone astray?\n\n\nIf he finds it, most certainly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray.\n\n\nEven so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.\n\n“If your brother sins against you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained back your brother.\n\n\nBut if he doesn’t listen, take one or two more with you, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.\n\nIf he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the assembly. If he refuses to hear the assembly also, let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector.\n\n\nMost certainly I tell you, whatever things you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever things you release on earth will have been released in heaven.\n\n\nAgain, assuredly I tell you, that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they will ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.\n\n\nFor where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in the middle of them.”\nThen Peter came and said to him, “Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?”\nJesus said to him,\n“I don’t tell you until seven times, but, until seventy times seven.\n\n\nTherefore the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who wanted to reconcile accounts with his servants.\n\n\nWhen he had begun to reconcile, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.\n\nBut because he couldn’t pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, with his wife, his children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.\n\n\nThe servant therefore fell down and knelt before him, saying, ‘Lord, have patience with me, and I will repay you all!’\n\n\nThe lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.\n\n“But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow servants, who owed him one hundred denarii,\nand he grabbed him, and took him by the throat, saying, ‘Pay me what you owe!’\n\n“So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will repay you!’\n\n\nHe would not, but went and cast him into prison, until he should pay back that which was due.\n\n\nSo when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were exceedingly sorry, and came and told their lord all that was done.\n\n\nThen his lord called him in, and said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because you begged me.\n\n\nShouldn’t you also have had mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you?’\n\n\nHis lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors, until he should pay all that was due to him.\n\n\nSo my heavenly Father will also do to you, if you don’t each forgive your brother from your hearts for his misdeeds.”\n",

Untie them, and bring them to me.\n\n\nIf anyone says anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and immediately he will send them.”\nAll this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,\n“Tell the daughter of Zion,\nbehold, your King comes to you,\nhumble, and riding on a donkey,\non a colt, the foal of a donkey.”\nThe disciples went, and did just as Jesus commanded them,\nand brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their clothes on them; and he sat on them.\nA very great multitude spread their clothes on the road. Others cut branches from the trees, and spread them on the road.\nThe multitudes who went in front of him, and those who followed, kept shouting, “Hosanna\n to the son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!”\n\nWhen he had come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred up, saying, “Who is this?”\nThe multitudes said, “This is the prophet, Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.”\nJesus entered into the temple of God, and drove out all of those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the money changers’ tables and the seats of those who sold the doves.\nHe said to them,\n“It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’\nbut you have made it a den of robbers!”\nThe blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them.\nBut when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children who were crying in the temple and saying, “Hosanna to the son of David!” they were indignant,\nand said to him, “Do you hear what these are saying?”\nJesus said to them,\n“Yes. Did you never read, ‘Out of the mouth of babes and nursing babies you have perfected praise?’”\nHe left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and camped there.\nNow in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry.\nSeeing a fig tree by the road, he came to it, and found nothing on it but leaves. He said to it,\n“Let there be no fruit from you forever!”\n\nImmediately the fig tree withered away.\nWhen the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, “How did the fig tree immediately wither away?”\nJesus answered them,\n“Most certainly I tell you, if you have faith, and don’t doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you told this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ it would be done.\n\n\nAll things, whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”\nWhen he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, “By what authority do you do these things? Who gave you this authority?”\nJesus answered them,\n“I also will ask you one question, which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.\n\n\nThe baptism of John, where was it from? From heaven or from men?”\n\nThey reasoned with themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’\nBut if we say, ‘From men,’ we fear the multitude, for all hold John as a prophet.”\nThey answered Jesus, and said, “We don’t know.”\nHe also said to them,\n“Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\n\n\nBut what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first, and said, ‘Son, go work today in my vineyard.’\n\n\nHe answered, ‘I will not,’ but afterward he changed his mind, and went.\n\n\nHe came to the second, and said the same thing. He answered, ‘I’ m going, sir,’ but he didn’t go.\n\n\nWhich of the two did the will of his father?”\nThey said to him, “The first.”\nJesus said to them,\n“Most certainly I tell you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering into God’s Kingdom before you.\n\n\nFor John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you didn’t believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. When you saw it, you didn’t even repent afterward, that you might believe him.\n\n\n“Hear another parable. There was a man who was a master of a household, who planted a vineyard, set a hedge about it, dug a wine press in it, built a tower, leased it out to farmers, and went into another country.\n\n\nWhen the season for the fruit came near, he sent his servants to the farmers, to receive his fruit.\n\n\nThe farmers took his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned another.\n\n\nAgain, he sent other servants more than the first: and they treated them the same way.\n\n\nBut afterward he sent to them his son, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’\n\n\nBut the farmers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, and seize his inheritance.’\n\n\nSo they took him, and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.\n\n\nWhen therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?”\nThey told him, “He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers, who will give him the fruit in its season.”\nJesus said to them,\n“Did you never read in the Scriptures,\n\n‘The stone which the builders rejected,\nthe same was made the head of the corner.\nThis was from the Lord.\nIt is marvelous in our eyes?’\n\n“Therefore I tell you, God’s Kingdom will be taken away from you, and will be given to a nation producing its fruit.\n\n\nHe who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but on whomever it will fall, it will scatter him as dust.”\nWhen the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke about them.\nWhen they sought to seize him, they feared the multitudes, because they considered him to be a prophet.\n",

My cattle and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the marriage feast!”’\n\n\nBut they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise,\n\n\nand the rest grabbed his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them.\n\n\nWhen the king heard that, he was angry, and sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.\n\n“Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding is ready, but those who were invited weren’t worthy.\n\n\nGo therefore to the intersections of the highways, and as many as you may find, invite to the marriage feast.’\n\n\nThose servants went out into the highways, and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good. The wedding was filled with guests.\n\n\nBut when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who didn’t have on wedding clothing,\n\n\nand he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing?’ He was speechless.\n\n\nThen the king said to the servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and throw him into the outer darkness. That is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.’\n\n\nFor many are called, but few chosen.”\nThen the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might entrap him in his talk.\nThey sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are honest, and teach the way of God in truth, no matter whom you teach, for you aren’t partial to anyone.\nTell us therefore, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”\nBut Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said,\n“Why do you test me, you hypocrites?\n\n\nShow me the tax money.”\nThey brought to him a denarius.\nHe asked them,\n“Whose is this image and inscription?”\nThey said to him, “Caesar’s.”\nThen he said to them,\n“Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”\nWhen they heard it, they marveled, and left him, and went away.\nOn that day Sadducees (those who say that there is no resurrection) came to him. They asked him,\nsaying, “Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up offspring for his brother.’\nNow there were with us seven brothers. The first married and died, and having no offspring left his wife to his brother.\nIn the same way, the second also, and the third, to the seventh.\nAfter them all, the woman died.\nIn the resurrection therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her.”\nBut Jesus answered them,\n“You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.\n\n\nFor in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like God’s angels in heaven.\n\n\nBut concerning the resurrection of the dead, haven’t you read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,\n\n\n‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?’\nGod is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”\nWhen the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.\nBut the Pharisees, when they heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered themselves together.\nOne of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, testing him.\n“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?”\nJesus said to him,\n“‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’\n\nThis is the first and great commandment.\n\n\nA second likewise is this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’\n\nThe whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments.”\n\nNow while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,\nsaying,\n“What do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?”\n\nThey said to him, “Of David.”\nHe said to them,\n“How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,\n\n‘The Lord said to my Lord,\nsit on my right hand,\nuntil I make your enemies a footstool for your feet?’\n\n“If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?”\nNo one was able to answer him a word, neither did any man dare ask him any more questions from that day forward.\n",

They make their phylacteries\n\nbroad, enlarge the fringes\nof their garments,\n\n\nand love the place of honor at feasts, the best seats in the synagogues,\n\n\nthe salutations in the marketplaces, and to be called ‘Rabbi, Rabbi’ by men.\n\n\nBut don’t you be called ‘Rabbi,’ for one is your teacher, the Christ, and all of you are brothers.\n\n\nCall no man on the earth your father, for one is your Father, he who is in heaven.\n\n\nNeither be called masters, for one is your master, the Christ.\n\n\nBut he who is greatest among you will be your servant.\n\n\nWhoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.\n\n“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows’ houses, and as a pretense you make long prayers. Therefore you will receive greater condemnation.\n\n“But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men; for you don’t enter in yourselves, neither do you allow those who are entering in to enter.\n\nWoe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel around by sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of Gehenna\nas yourselves.\n\n\n“Woe to you, you blind guides, who say, ‘Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is obligated.’\n\n\nYou blind fools! For which is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?\n\n\n‘Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, he is obligated?’\n\n\nYou blind fools! For which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifies the gift?\n\n\nHe therefore who swears by the altar, swears by it, and by everything on it.\n\n\nHe who swears by the temple, swears by it, and by him who has been living\nin it.\n\n\nHe who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by him who sits on it.\n\n“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint, dill, and cumin,\nand have left undone the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faith. But you ought to have done these, and not to have left the other undone.\n\n\nYou blind guides, who strain out a gnat, and swallow a camel!\n\n\n“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and unrighteousness.\n\nYou blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and of the platter, that its outside may become clean also.\n\n“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitened tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness.\n\n\nEven so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.\n\n“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and decorate the tombs of the righteous,\n\n\nand say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we wouldn’t have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.’\n\n\nTherefore you testify to yourselves that you are children of those who killed the prophets.\n\n\nFill up, then, the measure of your fathers.\n\n\nYou serpents, you offspring of vipers, how will you escape the judgment of Gehenna?\n\nTherefore behold, I send to you prophets, wise men, and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify; and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city;\n\n\nthat on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar.\n\n\nMost certainly I tell you, all these things will come upon this generation.\n\n“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! How often I would have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you would not!\n\n\nBehold, your house is left to you desolate.\n\n\nFor I tell you, you will not see me from now on, until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!’”\n",

His disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple.\n But he answered them,\n“You see all of these things, don’t you? Most certainly I tell you, there will not be left here one stone on another, that will not be thrown down.”\nAs he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?”\nJesus answered them,\n“Be careful that no one leads you astray.\n\n\nFor many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will lead many astray.\n\n\nYou will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you aren’t troubled, for all this must happen, but the end is not yet.\n\n\nFor nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines, plagues, and earthquakes in various places.\n\n\nBut all these things are the beginning of birth pains.\n\n\nThen they will deliver you up to oppression, and will kill you. You will be hated by all of the nations for my name’s sake.\n\n\nThen many will stumble, and will deliver up one another, and will hate one another.\n\n\nMany false prophets will arise, and will lead many astray.\n\n\nBecause iniquity will be multiplied, the love of many will grow cold.\n\n\nBut he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.\n\n\nThis Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.\n\n“When, therefore, you see the abomination of desolation,\n\nwhich was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),\n\n\nthen let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.\n\n\nLet him who is on the housetop not go down to take out the things that are in his house.\n\n\nLet him who is in the field not return back to get his clothes.\n\n\nBut woe to those who are with child and to nursing mothers in those days!\n\n\nPray that your flight will not be in the winter, nor on a Sabbath,\n\n\nfor then there will be great oppression, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be.\n\n\nUnless those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved. But for the sake of the chosen ones, those days will be shortened.\n\n\n“Then if any man tells you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ,’ or, ‘There,’ don’t believe it.\n\n\nFor there will arise false christs, and false prophets, and they will show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.\n\n“Behold, I have told you beforehand.\n\n\nIf therefore they tell you, ‘Behold, he is in the wilderness,’ don’t go out; ‘Behold, he is in the inner rooms,’ don’t believe it.\n\n\nFor as the lightning flashes from the east, and is seen even to the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.\n\n\nFor wherever the carcass is, that is where the vultures\n\ngather together.\n\n\nBut immediately after the oppression of those days, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken;\n\nand then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. Then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory.\n\n\nHe will send out his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n“Now from the fig tree learn this parable. When its branch has now become tender, and produces its leaves, you know that the summer is near.\n\n\nEven so you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.\n\n\nMost certainly I tell you, this generation\nwill not pass away, until all these things are accomplished.\n\n\nHeaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.\n\n\nBut no one knows of that day and hour, not even the angels of heaven,\nbut my Father only.\n\n“As the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.\n\n\nFor as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ship,\n\n\nand they didn’t know until the flood came, and took them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.\n\n\nThen two men will be in the field: one will be taken and one will be left.\n\n\nTwo women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and one will be left.\n\n\nWatch therefore, for you don’t know in what hour your Lord comes.\n\n\nBut know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.\n\n\nTherefore also be ready, for in an hour that you don’t expect, the Son of Man will come.\n\n“Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord has set over his household, to give them their food in due season?\n\n\nBlessed is that servant whom his lord finds doing so when he comes.\n\n\nMost certainly I tell you that he will set him over all that he has.\n\n\nBut if that evil servant should say in his heart, ‘My lord is delaying his coming,’\n\n\nand begins to beat his fellow servants, and eat and drink with the drunkards,\n\n\nthe lord of that servant will come in a day when he doesn’t expect it, and in an hour when he doesn’t know it,\n\n\nand will cut him in pieces, and appoint his portion with the hypocrites.

The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!’\n\n\nThen all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.\n\nThe foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’\n\n\nBut the wise answered, saying, ‘What if there isn’t enough for us and you? You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.’\n\n\nWhile they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.\n\n\nAfterward the other virgins also came, saying, ‘Lord, Lord, open to us.’\n\n\nBut he answered, ‘Most certainly I tell you, I don’t know you.’\n\n\nWatch therefore, for you don’t know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming.\n\n“For it is like a man, going into another country, who called his own servants, and entrusted his goods to them.\n\n\nTo one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his own ability. Then he went on his journey.\n\n\nImmediately he who received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents.\n\n\nIn the same way, he also who got the two gained another two.\n\n\nBut he who received the one talent went away and dug in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.\n\n“Now after a long time the lord of those servants came, and reconciled accounts with them.\n\n\nHe who received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, ‘Lord, you delivered to me five talents. Behold, I have gained another five talents besides them.’\n\n“His lord said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.’\n\n“He also who got the two talents came and said, ‘Lord, you delivered to me two talents. Behold, I have gained another two talents besides them.’\n\n\n“His lord said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.’\n\n“He also who had received the one talent came and said, ‘Lord, I knew you that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.\n\n\nI was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours.’\n\n“But his lord answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I didn’t sow, and gather where I didn’t scatter.\n\n\nYou ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back my own with interest.\n\n\nTake away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents.\n\n\nFor to everyone who has will be given, and he will have abundance, but from him who doesn’t have, even that which he has will be taken away.\n\n\nThrow out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’\n\n“But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory.\n\n\nBefore him all the nations will be gathered, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.\n\n\nHe will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.\n\n\nThen the King will tell those on his right hand, ‘Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;\n\n\nfor I was hungry, and you gave me food to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a stranger, and you took me in.\n\n\nI was naked, and you clothed me. I was sick, and you visited me. I was in prison, and you came to me.’\n\n“Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you; or thirsty, and give you a drink?\n\n\nWhen did we see you as a stranger, and take you in; or naked, and clothe you?\n\n\nWhen did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you?’\n\n“The King will answer them, ‘Most certainly I tell you, because you did it to one of the least of these my brothers,\n you did it to me.’\n\n\nThen he will say also to those on the left hand, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels;\n\n\nfor I was hungry, and you didn’t give me food to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;\n\n\nI was a stranger, and you didn’t take me in; naked, and you didn’t clothe me; sick, and in prison, and you didn’t visit me.’\n\n“Then they will also answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and didn’t help you?’\n\n“Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Most certainly I tell you, because you didn’t do it to one of the least of these, you didn’t do it to me.’\n\n\nThese will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”\n",

She has done a good work for me.\n\n\nFor you always have the poor with you; but you don’t always have me.\n\n\nFor in pouring this ointment on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.\n\n\nMost certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her.”\nThen one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,\nand said, “What are you willing to give me, that I should deliver him to you?” They weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver.\nFrom that time he sought opportunity to betray him.\nNow on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?”\nHe said,\n“Go into the city to a certain person, and tell him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.”’”\nThe disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and they prepared the Passover.\nNow when evening had come, he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.\nAs they were eating, he said,\n“Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me.”\nThey were exceedingly sorrowful, and each began to ask him, “It isn’t me, is it, Lord?”\nHe answered,\n“He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me.\n\n\nThe Son of Man goes, even as it is written of him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born.”\nJudas, who betrayed him, answered, “It isn’t me, is it, Rabbi?”\nHe said to him,\n“You said it.”\nAs they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks for it, and broke it. He gave to the disciples, and said,\n“Take, eat; this is my body.”\nHe took the cup, gave thanks, and gave to them, saying,\n“All of you drink it,\n\n\nfor this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the remission of sins.\n\n\nBut I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father’s Kingdom.”\n\nWhen they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.\nThen Jesus said to them,\n“All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’\n\nBut after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.”\n\nBut Peter answered him, “Even if all will be made to stumble because of you, I will never be made to stumble.”\nJesus said to him,\n“Most certainly I tell you that tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”\nPeter said to him, “Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.” All of the disciples also said likewise.\nThen Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples,\n“Sit here, while I go there and pray.”\nHe took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and severely troubled.\nThen he said to them,\n“My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch with me.”\nHe went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying,\n“My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you desire.”\nHe came to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said to Peter,\n“What, couldn’t you watch with me for one hour?\n\n\nWatch and pray, that you don’t enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”\nAgain, a second time he went away, and prayed, saying,\n“My Father, if this cup can’t pass away from me unless I drink it, your desire be done.”\n\nHe came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.\nHe left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words.\nThen he came to his disciples, and said to them,\n“Sleep on now, and take your rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.\n\n\nArise, let’s be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.”\n\nWhile he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.\nNow he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, “Whoever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him.”\nImmediately he came to Jesus, and said, “Hail, Rabbi!” and kissed him.\nJesus said to him,\n“Friend, why are you here?” Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.\nBehold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.\nThen Jesus said to him,\n“Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by the sword.\n\n\nOr do you think that I couldn’t ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?\n\n\nHow then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?”\n\nIn that hour Jesus said to the multitudes,\n“Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you didn’t arrest me.\n\n\nBut all this has happened, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.”\nThen all the disciples left him, and fled.\nThose who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.\nBut Peter followed him from a distance, to the court of the high priest, and entered in and sat with the officers, to see the end.\nNow the chief priests, the elders, and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death;\nand they found none.

What is this that these testify against you?”\nBut Jesus held his peace. The high priest answered him, “I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.”\nJesus said to him,\n“You have said it.

Why do we need any more witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.\nWhat do you think?”\nThey answered, “He is worthy of death!”\nThen they spat in his face and beat him with their fists, and some slapped him,\nsaying, “Prophesy to us, you Christ!

      "text": "Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:\nand they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor.\nThen Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,\nsaying, “I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood.”\nBut they said, “What is that to us? You see to it.”\nHe threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary, and departed. He went away and hanged himself.\nThe chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, “It’s not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.”\nThey took counsel, and bought the potter’s field with them, to bury strangers in.\nTherefore that field was called “The Field of Blood” to this day.\nThen that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying,\n“They took the thirty pieces of silver,\nthe price of him upon whom a price had been set,\nwhom some of the children of Israel priced,\nand they gave them for the potter’s field,\nas the Lord commanded me.”\nNow Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, “Are you the King of the Jews?”\nJesus said to him,\n“So you say.”\nWhen he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.\nThen Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many things they testify against you?”\nHe gave him no answer, not even one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.\nNow at the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they desired.\nThey had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.\nWhen therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Christ?”\nFor he knew that because of envy they had delivered him up.\nWhile he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of him.”\nNow the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.\nBut the governor answered them, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?”\nThey said, “Barabbas!”\nPilate said to them, “What then shall I do to Jesus, who is called Christ?”\nThey all said to him, “Let him be crucified!”\nBut the governor said, “Why? What evil has he done?”\nBut they cried out exceedingly, saying, “Let him be crucified!”\nSo when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it.”\nAll the people answered, “May his blood be on us, and on our children!”\nThen he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified.\nThen the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together against him.\nThey stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him.\nThey braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”\nThey spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.\nWhen they had mocked him, they took the robe off him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.\nAs they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his cross.\nWhen they came to a place called “Golgotha”, that is to say, “The place of a skull,”\nthey gave him sour wine to drink mixed with gall. When he had tasted it, he would not drink.\nWhen they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among them, casting lots,\nand they sat and watched him there.\nThey set up over his head the accusation against him written, “THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.”\nThen there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left.\nThose who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads,\nand saying, “You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!”\nLikewise the chief priests also mocking, with the scribes, the Pharisees, and the elders, said,\n“He saved others, but he can’t save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.\nHe trusts in God. Let God deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”\nThe robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach.\nNow from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.\nAbout the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,\n“Eli, Eli, lima\nsabachthani?”\n That is,\n“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”\nSome of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, “This man is calling Elijah.”\nImmediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him a drink.\nThe rest said, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to save him.”\nJesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.\nBehold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split.\nThe tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;\nand coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.\nNow the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, “Truly this was the Son of God.”\nMany women were there watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him.\nAmong them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.\nWhen evening had come, a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who himself was also Jesus’ disciple came.\nThis man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up.\nJoseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,\nand laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone against the door of the tomb, and departed.\nMary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.\nNow on the next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,\nsaying, “Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive: ‘After three days I will rise again.’\nCommand therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, ‘He is risen from the dead;’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.”\nPilate said to them, “You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can.”\nSo they went with the guard and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone.\n",
